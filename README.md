# 6502_emulator
--- THIS PROJECT IS A WIP ---

This is a work in progress project I am using to learn C++ and improve my understanding of the MOS 6502 processor.

To build this emulator I am using documentation found online

https://www.nesdev.org/obelisk-6502-guide/reference.html

http://www.6502.org/users/obelisk/6502/instructions.html

Looking at other implementation like https://github.com/gianlucag/mos6502 has been incredibly useful.

I have also been testing my results against https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/, which is an amazing resource to understand how assembly language works in 6502.
